				<h3>Vision for the Future</h3>
			</div>
			<div id=vision>
				<p>
					From a young age I have always been facinated by technology, I admiried
					how some thing so little, so compact and so sleek could do something that amazing.
					At first I would take apart my toys and put them back together to "fix them" and
					when I got my computer with all of its programs I would get giddy and
					try something similar again. I've learnt over the years that what really
					makes me happy is knowing how things working, putting them back together
					in my own way and watch my creation do what it can and that is what I am
					working for as it reguards to my carrier path. I want to make something of
					my design as I watch my it grow to do all it can and hopefully more.
